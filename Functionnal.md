## Glossary

- **AppNews Network** : The project that we are working on.

# Introduction

[Jacobi](https://www.jacobi.net), a company located in Vierzon, needs a communication tool that could send informations based on  what the user requests, in order to facilitate the information transmission between employees. Jacobi has their head office in Paris. 

## Scope

The most important points of this project is to be able to control the displayed content remotely, they also have to be independent to each other, which means that we could display different content on each screen. 

## In Scope

These are the mains features that are planned in our V0 : 
- Adapt the content to the screen size
- Widgets for weather, news, etc. that will be updated on a regular basis
- An history of the displayed content with a tracking of who changed what
- A login page the website to ensure that only authorized people can use it (there will only be 4 people who will have their access granted to the tool)
- Planning messages for a given date (i.e Friday for Monday)
- English and French languages
- Draft system (you can start writing a message and finish writing it later)

  
## Out Of Scope
 
Due to time and resources constraints, these features might be included in the upcoming versions :
- Different languages (other than English or French)
- Smart screen in Paris to display informations
- Unique logins for each users 




# Functional requirements

## Assumptions
- Content will be displayed horizontally.
- Both buildings are connected to the same network.
- 
## Constraints

- Small shutdown at Christmas time.
- Wi-Fi sometimes had issues.
