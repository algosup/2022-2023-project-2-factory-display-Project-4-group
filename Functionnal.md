## About the laws


# Non goals

This project won't support the following features :

- ...

# Requirements 

The most important points of this project is to be able to control the displayed content remotely, they also have to be independent to each other, which means that we could display different content on each screen. We have planned those features :

- Adapt the content to the screen size
- Widgets for weather, news, etc. that will be updated on a regular basis
- An history of the displayed content
- An access rights to the screen to ensure there is no risk of it being misused
- An access rights to the tool to ensure that only authorized people can use it (there will only be 4 people who will have their access granted to the tool)
  
# Out Of Scope
 
Due to time constraints, these features might be included in the upcoming versions :
- Different languages 
- Smart screen in Paris to display informations
- Unique logins for each users
